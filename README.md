# Week 4 — Assignment: Advanced Visualization with ggplot2 (25 pts)

**Goal:** Build on last week’s `nc.csv` work to demonstrate:
- **Enhancing Scatterplots:** add a regression line to show linear trends.
- **Advanced Bar Charts:** summarize, reorder bars, and consider alternatives (dot/lollipop).
- **Enriching Histograms:** use `fill` to create stacked/grouped comparisons.
- **Polishing Your Visuals:** use titles, subtitles, captions effectively.
- **ggplot2 Themes:** apply built-in themes (e.g., `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`).

## What to do
1. Open `src/week4_assignment.R` in RStudio.
2. Complete each **TODO**. Keep answers brief in **comments** (e.g., `# ANSWER: ...`).  
3. Run code to view plots in the Plots pane.
4. **Commit & push** your updated `src/week4_assignment.R` (and any optional saved images) to GitHub.

> **Data:** This assignment expects `data/nc.csv` (same file from last week).

## Submission
Push your completed script to GitHub and submit the link to your GitHub repository in Blackboard.
